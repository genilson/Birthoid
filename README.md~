in the repo for the sake of convenience) along with the application project.
After importing, make sure to right click the project's folder, select
properties -> android and set facebook library in the libraries section.

> Import and execute the project through eclipse or another IDE of your preference
or install the .apk file in an Android phone. The .apk can be found in /bin.
